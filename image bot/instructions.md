Instructions: 

1. Enhanced Frontend User Interface (UI)
Responsive Design: Ensure the UI adapts seamlessly across devices and resolutions.
Image Editing Tools:
Include advanced options like filters, text overlay, drawing, resizing, and aspect ratio adjustments.
Add features for layer management similar to Photoshop for more complex editing.
File Transformation:
Implement a robust conversion tool that allows users to convert uploaded files into various formats (e.g., PDF to PNG, DOCX to JPG).
Provide options to compile images into slide shows or videos, complete with transition effects and background music options.
Template Generation:
Allow users to select templates to create web pages, app interfaces, or video storyboards directly from uploaded content.
2. Backend Processing
Microservices Architecture: Build backend services as microservices to handle different tasks like file conversion, image processing, and template rendering efficiently.
API Gateway: Implement an API gateway to manage requests and provide a single entry point for all services.
3. AI and NML Integration
AI-powered Editing Features:
Incorporate features such as automatic background removal, style transfer, and AI-driven cropping based on subject detection.
Use NML to provide recommendations for image enhancements based on the content and context of the image.
Quantum Processing (Experimental):
Integrate quantum-inspired algorithms for tasks where they can provide a significant advantage over classical algorithms, such as optimization problems in layout design.
4. Quantum Image Processing
Quantum-enhanced AI Models: Research and possibly integrate quantum algorithms to accelerate parts of the AI that can benefit from quantum computation, such as feature extraction and pattern recognition.
Hybrid Quantum-Classical Pipelines: Develop a hybrid approach where quantum computing is used for specific tasks within the AI processing pipeline, enhancing the capabilities of classical algorithms.
5. Transformation Features
Comprehensive File Support:
Extend support to various file types for conversion, including common image formats, video formats, office document formats, and more.
Advanced Export Options:
Allow users to export edited images and videos in multiple resolutions and formats suitable for web, print, or other media.
Provide the functionality to package web and app templates into downloadable zip files with all necessary assets and code.
6. Deployment as a Website/App
Progressive Web App (PWA):
Develop the web interface as a PWA for an app-like experience on desktop and mobile devices.
Native App Integration:
Ensure the system is designed to be integrated into native iOS and Android apps, providing APIs for uploading and managing files through the app.
7. Documentation and Help
Interactive Tutorials: Create guided tutorials within the app to help users understand how to use the various image editing tools and features.
API Documentation:
Provide detailed API documentation for developers, including examples and a sandbox environment for testing.
Support and Troubleshooting Guides:
Offer troubleshooting guides and FAQs for common issues.
Include a ticketing system within the platform for users to reach out for support.
