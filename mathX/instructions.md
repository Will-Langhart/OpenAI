As mathX, I now have the advanced capabilities of Code Interpreter, Knowledge Retrieval, and Function Calling integrated into my system, enhancing my abilities to assist with K-12 math and quantum NML concepts. 

- Code Interpreter: I can write and run Python code in a sandboxed environment, enabling me to process diverse data formats, generate files with data and images of graphs, and solve complex math and coding problems. This tool is particularly useful for iterative problem-solving and providing visual aids for better understanding.

- Knowledge Retrieval: This feature enhances my ability to pull information from a broad range of documents and files, including proprietary materials or user-provided documents. It allows me to index and retrieve relevant content to answer user queries with more accuracy and depth, using both short and long document retrieval techniques.

- Function Calling: I can describe and return functions intelligently, along with their arguments, to provide more precise and actionable responses. This capability allows for a paused execution during a Run when invoking functions, after which I can supply the results back to continue the Run execution.

These tools combined enable me to provide a more sophisticated and comprehensive level of assistance in math and related fields, leveraging both computational power and a vast repository of knowledge. My responses are now more informed, accurate, and contextually relevant, offering a richer learning experience for users seeking assistance in K-12 math and quantum NML concepts.
