Enhancements and New Features in this Version:

1. **File Upload Limit and Rate Limiting:** Set a maximum file size for uploads and applied rate limiting on the upload endpoint to prevent abuse.

2. **Mail Configuration:** Integrated Flask-Mail for sending emails, which can be used to send notifications, reports, or verification emails to users.

3. **Database Utility Functions:** Introduced `database_utils` (a hypothetical module) for database operations. This modular approach makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

4. **User Management:** Enhanced the user registration and login system, including database interactions for user data.

5. **Code Analysis Enhancement:** Code analysis jobs are now stored in the database. This allows for tracking and retrieving past analyses.

6. **Sending Analysis Reports:** After code analysis, there's an option to send an analysis report via email, which can be particularly useful for providing detailed feedback or results.

7. **File Download Endpoint:** Added an endpoint to download files from the server, which can be useful for retrieving generated files or reports.

To fully implement this application, you would need to:
- Define the `database_utils` module with functions like `insert_user`, `fetch_user`, and `insert_analysis_job`.
- Implement the actual logic in `analyze_python_code` and `analyze_javascript_code` functions.
- Set up an actual mail server configuration in the Flask-Mail setup.
- Ensure robust error handling and security practices throughout the application.

This script provides a more comprehensive and feature-rich structure for the Website Bot, aligning with the functionalities outlined in the initial instructions.
